# neovimconfig

My neovim configuration &amp; scripts

## Origins

Started off with and based this off the [kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim) configuration which was majorly helpful. Big thanks to them!

I've added buffer management, filetree, setup debugging for several languages including C#, Typescript & C++ over two or three months.

Windows CMD command to setup wezterm:

`copy .wezterm.lua %USERPROFILE%\&mkdir %USERPROFILE%\.cache\wezterm`
